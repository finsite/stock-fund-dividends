# 🧱 stock-fund-dividends

## Overview

This repository provides a standardized template for building Python-based
microservices and utilities. It includes preconfigured tooling for testing,
linting, formatting, dependency management, Dockerization, and Kubernetes
scaffolding.

Use this template to quickly bootstrap new repositories in the `stock-*`
ecosystem or any production-grade Python project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- `make`
- `pip` and `pip-tools`
- Optional: Docker, kubectl, and helm (for deployment)

### 🔧 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
make install
⚙️ Environment Variables
Define required environment variables in your config module or via Vault. This template does not rely on .env files by default.

Optional: Use Vault, AWS SSM, or environment injection for secure configuration.

🧪 Running Tests
Run unit tests and type checks using:

bash
Copy
Edit
make test        # Runs pytest
make lint        # Runs ruff and mypy
make format      # Auto-formats code with ruff
All tools are pre-configured via pyproject.toml and pre-commit.

🐳 Docker Support
This template includes a minimal Dockerfile to containerize the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t your-service .
docker run --rm your-service
☸️ Kubernetes & GitOps
A k8s/ folder is provided for ArgoCD-compatible Kubernetes manifests. These can be customized for:

Deployments or Jobs

ConfigMaps and Secrets

Role-based service accounts

Helm or Kustomize overlays

🧰 Built With
Python

Ruff – Linting & formatting
